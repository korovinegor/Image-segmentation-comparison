This repository contains results of an educational practice on a topic “Comparison and implementation of image segmentation methods.”

Contents:
* Images: test images used to compare methods,
* Images (thresholding): test images segmented using a lower threshold method,
* Images (histogram-based): test images segmented using a histogram method,
* Images (thresholding): test images segmented using a watershed method,
* segmentation.py: image segmentation using the lower threshold, histogram or watershed methods.

Program for segmentation (segmentation.py) was written in Python. It uses OpenCV for implementation of segmentation methods.
